# OpenClaw Platform — Agent Operating Addendum

## Vanguard Territory Map (Shared Strategic Memory)

This project maintains a **shared territory map** for frontier discovery and direction-setting.

- Canonical file (committed): `ops/openclaw-platform/docs/TERRITORY_MAP.md`
- Optional runtime mirror (shared mount): `/home/node/shared/TERRITORY_MAP.md`

## Mandatory Use

Before proposing or starting vanguard work:

1. Read the territory map.
2. Place the proposed work into one of three buckets:
   - Occupied (already solved)
   - Adjacent (incremental extension)
   - Uncharted (vanguard)
3. If uncharted, add:
   - why current territory is insufficient
   - expected strategic leverage
   - first falsifiable milestone
4. Update the map after each meaningful artifact so the map stays fresh.

## Ownership Protocol

- The map is shared, always editable, always current.
- All agents contribute deltas; no one “owns” it exclusively.
- Heartbeat artifacts should reference which territory lane they advance.
