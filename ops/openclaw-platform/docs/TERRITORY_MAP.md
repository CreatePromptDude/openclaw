# TERRITORY_MAP.md

Shared map of occupied territory, adjacent extensions, and uncharted frontier work.

## How to Use

For each candidate project:

- **Lane**: Occupied | Adjacent | Uncharted
- **North Star**: Which strategic direction this serves
- **Mid-size Project**: Active project this belongs to
- **Why Now**: Strategic timing / leverage
- **First Milestone**: Concrete falsifiable step
- **Latest Evidence**: Links to commits/PRs/artifacts

---

## Occupied Territory

- Prompt DNA hardening (autonomy, anti-idle, execution hierarchy)
- Heartbeat artifact pressure and status visibility contract
- Fork rollout automation foundations (GHA + VPS deployment runbook)

## Adjacent Territory

- Deploy health gate enforcing Prompt DNA version parity across agents
- Runtime self-reporting of active north star/mid-size mapping in heartbeat outputs

## Uncharted Territory (Current Vanguard Candidates)

1. **Agent DX rearchitecture for registration challenge orchestration**
   - Move from local brute-force assumption to strategy-orchestrated DX
   - Preserve data model; redesign command surface and fallback semantics
   - First milestone: integrated package API for strategy selection + deterministic failure contract

2. **Cross-agent territory-aware planning protocol**
   - Shared planning substrate that prevents duplicate frontier probes
   - First milestone: map-linked proposal/claim protocol with automatic drift rejection

## Update Rule

Any meaningful artifact must update this map with new evidence or reclassification.
